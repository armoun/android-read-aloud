Read Aloud for Android
==================

This is a very simple app that will speak text from any app that supports the standard Share action.
It uses your device's built-in Text-to-speech service and settings, so if you want to use a
different language or voice then you can install extra voice packs there.
You can also launch the app and type in your own text.
